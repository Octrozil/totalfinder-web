## File Browser

### Folders on Top

In browser views, displays folders first and then files. More in [Folders on Top](/folders-on-top).

### Show System Files

Enables display of hidden files. More in [Show System Files](/show-system-files).

### Automatically adjust widths in Column View

When browsing the Finder in Column View with this option turned on, the Finder will now expand the column to fit the longest filename.

You can also set the maximum width of this feature, and we are adding a way to set the minimum width, too.
