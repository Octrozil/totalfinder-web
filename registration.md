## Thanks for considering buying TotalFinder

The process is straight-forward and should take less than 5 minutes in 3 steps.

## Step 1: Buy a license from [the web store](https://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/instant/totalfinder)

<div class="note">Click on "Store" in the main menu of BinaryAge.com.  Please note that if you're considering buying two licenses, you should buy three because the price for three is the same (TotalFinder with Friends option). <br> </div>

## Step 2: Wait for an email with "TotalFinder License" in the subject

In most cases you should get it instantly after the payment.

We all know that even important emails can sometimes end up in a spam folder. Please double check your spam before you [report a missing email](mailto:support@binaryage.com?subject=Didn't%20get%20registration%20email). I'm using [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com), which is rock-solid, so a mistake by our mail robots is unlikely.

In my Gmail the message looks like this:

## Step 4: Enter your license into the Registration Dialog

You may click on the window badge:

Or you may go through TotalFinder Preferences / About / Register button.
Please make sure you copy and paste the license information from the email exactly and without surrounding quotes.

Click Register and you get this happy screen if you did it right:
