## Do you know .DS_Store files?

Asepsis allows you to redirect creation of .DS_Store files. This is particularly a feature for users who use command-line tools.

Asepsis was removed from TotalFinder into a seperate product. Please read more at [asepsis.binaryage.com](http://asepsis.binaryage.com).
